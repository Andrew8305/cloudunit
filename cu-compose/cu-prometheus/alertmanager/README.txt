This folder contains two files :
- config.yml
- slack.config.yml

config.yml is used to send notifications by email whereas config.yml.slack is the configuration file used to receive notifications on slack.

You have to edit the configuration you want to use with your credentials. And the one you want to use must be named "config.yml" . Just rename the other one.
